# TripSplit
-Personal project.
-This project is to help friends split their money for their trip.
-Example: a group of friends hanging out. 1 Person pay for the meal and the rest will zelle back later.
-       : We can use this to calculate how much each person has to zelle back.
-Example #2: a group of friends go on vacation. only 2 couple will pay for meals/hotels. The rest will zelle back later. How can the other people know how much to zelle back? We will this to determine.
        : We'll keep receipt and then put it into this project. This will calculate how much each person/couple have to pay back.
                                ----------------------------
-There will be features added to this later.
-As of right now it is good to do easy task such as add input and do the calculation.
-Later, i will add feature such as a reset button, edit each input.
-Reset button - this will reset the whole thing. Just like a refresh button on the web browser.
-Edit each input - this will let the user to select a specific person or couple to edit in their input.
                -Example - they pay for something and forgot to add it to the program. They will be able to add it to a program.
